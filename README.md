# Credit Card Spend Analysis

# üí≥ Customer Credit Card Spend Analysis Dashboard

This project presents a complete end-to-end solution for analyzing customer credit card behavior using PostgreSQL and Power BI. 

It combines SQL queries with business intelligence dashboards to extract insights from customer, spending, and repayment datasets.


## üéØ Project Objectives

- To analyze consumer credit card usage patterns across demographics, cities, and card types.

- To understand product categories where customers spend the most.

- To identify repayment behavior and detect potential late-paying customers.

- To determine the average credit limit and age of credit card users.

- To build a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and patterns effectively.

To support data-driven decisions for financial product offerings and customer segmentation.


## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The project utilizes three CSV files representing different aspects of customer activity:


### 1. Customer Data

- `Columns:` num, customer_id, age, city, card_type, credit_limit, company, job_segment  

- `Purpose:` Stores customer demographics and credit card metadata.


### 2. Repayment Data

- `Columns:` sl_no, customer_id, date, amount  

- `Purpose:` Tracks repayment transactions for each customer.


### 3. Spend Data

- `Columns:` sl_no, customer_id, date, product_type, amount  

- `Purpose:` Captures product-wise spending by customers.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL / pgAdmin4** ‚Äì For database creation, data manipulation, and SQL querying

- **Power BI** ‚Äì For building an interactive dashboard

- **CSV Files** ‚Äì As data source inputs



## üß± Database Setup

### üîπ Step 1: Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE credit_card_analysis;

üîπ Step 2: Create Tables

**Customer Table**

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    num SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    card_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    credit_limit NUMERIC(15, 2) NOT NULL,
    company VARCHAR(50),
    job_segment VARCHAR(50)
);


**Repayment Table**

CREATE TABLE Repayment (
    sl_no SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(10) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC(15, 2) NOT NULL
);


**Spend Table**

CREATE TABLE Spend (
    sl_no SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id VARCHAR(10) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    product_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC(15, 2) NOT NULL
);


üîπ Step 3: Data Import

Right-click on each table in pgAdmin > Import/Export and load the CSV files.
